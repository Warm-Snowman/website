        <h1><strong>way of the man</strong></h1>
        <p>
            Marred is a man's journey,
            <em>with pain and suffering</em>.
            Thus has it been so since the <strong>Dawn of time</strong>.
            For when his <strong>sweat and blood</strong> sacralizes the ground, shall it flourish
            from which his brother kind will eat.
            <br>
            He is the shepherd and the soldier of his family, for in his strength lies the lives of 
            his those beloved. He is the sword of god, the harbringer of his righteous fury, for the 
            land that he protects shall it bare forth harvest of tomorrow.
