Notes:

>We always name the homepage of our website as index.html because by default webservers will look for index.html

>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It's a not a programming language rather a markup language to define
how and what elements are used, structured etc.

>In html we have elements and tags. Element is a container that holds contents and tags define the kind of element it is.
We have normal element tags that have both an opening and closing tags and we have void tags that do not have a closing tag.
Example <br>. Sometimes void tags are referenced as self closing tags such as <br/> but these are not used in the current html5 standards


*Learn what are markup languages, Data serialization languages, JSON*
> When we start an html document we always include <!DOCTYPE html> to tell the browser the version of html we're using
the latest version of html at the time of writing this note is html5.

>lang specifies the language of the text content in that element. This attribute is primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage. 
It allows assistive technologies, for example screen readers, to adapt according to the language and invoke correct pronunciation.

>The head element is where we put meta information. We must not use any element here that displays content on the webpage
We should always have the <meta> tag with the charset encoding of the webpage in the <head> element: <meta charset="UTF-8">.
Setting the encoding is very important because it ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser.

>We must use title element to display the title of our webpage. Lack of which would create a meaningless webpage. By default, the browser would display the name of the webpage
if title element is not provided.

>The body element is where the main contents lie.
